# Desse
Ultra fast binary serialization and deserialization for types with a constant size (known at compile time). This
crate cannot be used to serialize or deserialize dynamically allocated types, such as,
[`String`](std::string::String), [`Vec`](std::vec::Vec), [`HashMap`](std::collections::HashMap), etc., and types 
with unknown size at compile time such as `slices`, `&str`, etc.

## Binary Encoding Scheme
This crate uses a minimal binary encoding scheme such that the size of encoded object will be smaller than (in cases
where Rust adds padding bytes for alignment) or equal to it's size in a running Rust program. For example, consider
the following `struct`:

```
struct MyStruct {
    a: u8,
    b: u16,
}
```

`Desse::serialize` will serialize this struct in `[u8; 3]` where `3` is the sum of sizes of `u8` and `u16`.

## Usage
Add `desse` in your `Cargo.toml`'s `dependencies` section.
```
[dependencies]
desse = "0.1"
```

`Desse` trait can be implemented for any struct (whose size is known at compile time) using `derive` macro. This
crate also provides a `derive` macro for implementing `DesseSized` trait which is necessary for implementing `Desse`
trait.
```
use desse::{Desse, DesseSized};

#[derive(Desse, DesseSized)]
struct MyStruct {
    a: u8,
    b: u16,
}
```

Now, you can use `Desse::serialize` and `Desse::deserialize_from` for serialization and deserialization of this 
struct.

```
let my_struct = MyStruct { a: 5, b: 1005 };
let serialized: [u8; 3] = my_struct.serialize();
let new_struct = MyStruct::deserialize_from(&serialized);

assert_eq!(my_struct, new_struct);
```

Note that `Desse::serialize` returns an array of fixed length (`3` in above case) and `Desse::deserialize` takes
reference to an array of fixed length as argument.

## Performance
This crate values performance more than anything. We don't shy away from using tested and verified **unsafe** code
if it improves performance.

## Future Improvements
Once [`const_generics`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2000-const-generics.md) is implemented
in Rust, we can provide default implementations for many types such as, `impl Desse for [T; n] where T: Desse`, and
other variable size statically allocated types in Rust.
